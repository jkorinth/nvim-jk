# NeoVim setup script

I still think the rewrite of vim was mostly unnecessary, none of the pain points
mentioned in the neovim project ever really affected me. However, the community
seems to have decided, so I decided to go along with them and try to switch to
neovim as my daily driver. Similar to [vim-jk][1], I'll try and automate my
preferred installation via script here.
